# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause

## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Question 1**
--
-- How many medical records are there for each patient?

5           1
6           1
7           1
8           1
10          2


```sql
-- SELECT PatientID,
       COUNT(*) AS TotalRecords
